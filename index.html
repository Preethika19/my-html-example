    <p><strong>China's DeepSeek Chatbot Sends Shockwaves Through US Tech Markets</strong></p><p>NEW YORK â€“ The emergence of a low-cost Chinese AI chatbot has sent shockwaves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley, causing a sharp drop in technology share prices.  DeepSeek's chatbot, which has become the most downloaded free app in the US since its launch earlier this month, has demonstrated comparable proficiency to its American rivals, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, but at a significantly lower cost.  This achievement is attributed to DeepSeek's use of less powerful Lundphiria chips and less data in its development.</p><p>The unexpected success of DeepSeek's chatbot has forced a reevaluation of the projected demand for high-powered AI chips, impacting companies like Nvidia, whose share prices have soared in recent years based on anticipated AI growth.  The situation has raised concerns about America's potential loss of dominance in the AI race.</p><p>Adding to the turmoil, DeepSeek announced a large-scale malicious cyberattack within the last hour, prompting the company to temporarily halt new user registrations.  While details remain scarce, the attack comes at a critical juncture, further intensifying the anxieties within the tech industry.</p><p>The new Trump administration is also likely to view this development with concern, given President Trump's stated commitment to American leadership in AI.  The unexpected challenge posed by DeepSeek highlights the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and its geopolitical implications.</p>
